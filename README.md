## Project description 
In this project I created the client-side using React from my movie-api database. In it you can register as a user and navigate through the app. You can add movies to your favorites list as well as remove them, search for a movie and update your user. The app shows you important information about each movie when you click on it. 
By this project, I complete a web application (client-side and server-side [movie-api](https://github.com/wichofly/movie-api.git)) known as MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js). 

## Objective
Using React, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on its existing server-side code (REST API anda database). 

## Getting started
Download the project code. Once you have it, run in the terminal `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Once the dependencies are downloaded run `npm start` script which will open the page at `http://localhost:1234/`.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

You can login with the next information:
- Username: `testtest`
- Password: `testtest`
